## Agents capabilities

| Agents capability       |            Description                  |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
**CICS topology agent**
Topology Support        | Answers questions about CICS TS by using various data sources, including information from subject matter experts (SMEs) and IBM product documentation. By providing understanding, recommendations, and best practices, it helps users to gain clarity and to make informed configuration and management decisions effectively.
SME interview data |Insights from IBM CICS subject matter experts to enhance accuracy and clarify complex behavior. It embeds best practices into responses to ensure that recommendations are grounded in real-world experience.
Z RAG Capabilities| Answers topology-related queries by using ingested IBM documentation from Z RAG, to provide clear, accurate, and structured insights into the CICS system setup and configuration.
Ranks Documentation | To improve relevance, prioritizes and ranks documents based on how well they match the user's query.
**CICS problem determination agent**
Problem determination Support |  Helps to diagnose issues in the user's CICS system by using various data sources, including live system data and IBM product documentation. It explains error codes (for example, DFHAC messages), identifies likely causes, and recommends next steps that are tailored to the user’s environment.
Z RAG Capabilities| Uses ingested IBM documentation from Z RAG to support problem determination.
Interacts with live CICS systems  | 	Executes read-only commands to retrieve real-time system data that supports analysis.
Tool Integration | Provides visibility into live CICS system behavior through MCP, including information about transaction and programs. This helps to maintain situational awareness and to support informed decision-making during investigations.
Extracts DFHAC message | Parses and interprets DFHAC error messages to support troubleshooting.
Adaptive response strategy | Dynamically responds using live system data when this data is available, or falls back to static documentation when it is not, depending on server availability.
**CICS tool calling agent**
Live System Queries | Executes targeted queries against live CICS systems to retrieve real-time resource information, including programs, transactions, files, dynamic storage areas, and system parameters.
MCP Tool Integration | Leverages MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools to interact with CICS regions and CICSplexes, providing visibility into current system state and configuration.
Resource Parsing | Intelligently parses user queries to identify specific CICS resources and their IDs, then selects appropriate tools to retrieve the requested information.
Context-Aware Responses | Generates summaries of live data with explanations of field values and their implications, helping users understand the current state of their CICS environment.
Multi-Resource Support | Handles queries about multiple resources simultaneously, processing each resource and consolidating results into a comprehensive response.
**CICS followup agent**
Follow-up Question Handling | Processes follow-up questions by analyzing conversation history to resolve ambiguous references and maintain context across multi-turn conversations.
Relevance Checking | Validates that queries are CICS-related before processing, ensuring the agent stays focused on its domain expertise.
Documentation Retrieval | Uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to search and rank relevant CICS documentation based on user queries and conversation context.
Context Resolution | Resolves pronouns and implicit references (e.g., "it", "that value") by examining conversation history to identify specific CICS terms and concepts.
Intent-Aware Search | Classifies query intent (informational, clarification, troubleshooting, comparison) to optimize documentation search strategies.
**CICS routing agent**
Question routing | Identifies the theme of the user's query and directs it to the most appropriate agent, ensuring the question is handled by the agent best suited to resolve it.


## Prerequisites
Ensure the following:
- [IBM watsonx Assistant for Z](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/waz/2.0.0?topic=install-watsonx-assistant-z) is installed
- The minimum version of z/OSMF is 3.1
- The agents require a watsonx Project ID.
  - This should be used as WATSONX_PROJECT_ID as an environment variable.

Additionally, the CICS problem determination agent requires:
- CICS Transaction Server for z/OS version 6.3 or later, with APAR PH68212 applied.
- MCP server running in CICS. See Configuring CICS MCP server https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cics-ts/6.x?topic=configuring-cics-mcp-server

Optionally, to validate container signatures, `skopeo` and `gpg`.

## Optional: Verify container signatures

You will need [skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo>) installed to validate signatures. You will aslo need `gpg` installed.

> The example commands validate the container for the CICS Topology Agent. To check the signatures for other CICS agent containers, change the tag accordingly.

#### Step 1: Importing the Key
This directory contains a file named `pubkey.asc`. To verify the signature, install this GPG Public Key into your local keyring.

First run: `gpg --import ./public_key.asc` to import the public key. You should see something like:

```
gpg: key F884D56B4AA7091A: public key "IBM CICS Transaction Server agents for Z <psirt@us.ibm.com>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
```

Now run `export FINGERPRINT=$(gpg --fingerprint --with-colons | grep fpr | tr -d 'fpr:')`
<br>

#### Step 2: Extracting the container

Sign in to skopeo so the container can be pulled with `skopeo login --username <USERNAME> --password <PASSWORD_OR_TOKEN> icr.io`.

Copy the container image to a temporary directory with `skopeo copy docker://icr.io/ibm-cics-ts/cics-ai-agent:topology-v1.0.0 dir:./tmp/`.
  
This copies blobs, manifests and signatures from the container into the `tmp` directory. The signature will usually be something like `signature-1`.
<br>

#### Step 3: Validating the signature

You can now verify the signature.. Run `skopeo standalone-verify ./tmp/manifest.json icr.io/ibm-cics-ts/cics-ai-agent:topology-v1.0.0 $FINGERPRINT ./tmp/signature-1`

You should see output like this:
```Signature verified using fingerprint B83574F1F039B21CDCC4FD5FF884D56B4AA7091A, digest sha256:f2f11696e64395b79a9f5e31b91bae4f8c802ae1548ffd831067b3eb3ed1f077```

If you see something else, such as an error, check the image was downloaded from a trusted source. An example of an incorrect signature verification would be:

```FATA[0000] Error verifying signature: Signature by B83574F1F039B21CDCC4FD5FF884D56B4AA7091A does not match expected fingerprints [B83574F1F039B21CDCC4FD5FF884D56B4AA7091B]```

You can now repeat this process for the other signature files in the `tmp` folder, and for other container images as part of the IBM CICS Transaction Server agents for Z product. 

> Remember to clear the folder `tmp` with `rm -rf ./tmp` after each image has been verified.

## Install the CICS Agent

### Retrieve the entitlement key

An entitlement key is required to download the IBM CICS Transaction Server agents for Z container images from the IBM Container Registry. This entitlement key is available at no charge to licensed users of IBM CICS Transaction Server for z/OS.

To obtain the entitlement key, open a case with IBM Support indicating that you are requesting the entitlement key for IBM CICS Transaction Server agents for Z. 

Once you have an entitlement key, paste it into the Helm chart under the `cics-agent` definitions like so:

```yaml
cics-agent:
  enabled: false
  acceptLicense: True  #IBM Terms - https://www.ibm.com/support/customer/csol/terms/?id=L-SSLZ-QYC4LH
  registry:
    name: cics-image-pull-secret
    createSecret: true
    server: icr.io
    username: iamapikey
    entitlementKey: "<CICS_ENTITLEMENT_KEY>"
```

## Topology agent configuration
### Create Shared Variables

Some variables are common across all agents. To configure these shared variables, refer to [Create shared variables](https://github.com/IBM/z-ai-agents/blob/main/README.md#1-global-settings).
However, if any of these shared variables are also defined in your agent-specific [values.yaml](https://github.com/IBM/z-ai-agents/blob/main/wxa4z-agent-suite/values.yaml) file, the values that you specify in the values.yaml file will override the shared ones.

### Configure the values.yaml file

To enable the CICS topology agent, you need to configure agent-specific values in the [values.yaml](https://github.com/IBM/z-ai-agents/blob/main/wxa4z-agent-suite/values.yaml) file.

In the values.yaml file, scroll down to the CICS Agent section and update the keys as outlined in the following table.

| Key       |            Description                  |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
**Environment variables**
WATSONX_MODEL_ID | Default model to use in LLM calls.
MODEL_CATALOG_PATH | File path to the YAML configuration file.
**Secrets**
WATSONX_API_KEY| Your watsonx API key.
WRAPPER_USERNAME| The username for the Z RAG instance in your cluster.
WRAPPER_PASSWORD| The password for the Z RAG instance in your cluster.
WRAPPER_URL| The URL for the Z RAG instance in your cluster.
INGESTION_URL| Endpoint URL for the data ingestion.
INGESTION_PASSWORD| Password that is used to authenticate with the ingestion service.
AGENT_ID| Unique identifier for the Agent instance, used to distinguish it within the watsonx Orchestrate.
AGENT_SECRET | Secret key used to securely authenticate the agent.
WATSONX_PROJECT_URL| Your watsonx URL.
WATSONX_PROJECT_ID| Identifier for your watsonx Project ID.
> DO NOT CHANGE VALUES IN `secrets` SECTION of  `values.yaml`

### Self signed certificates

If you are connecting to a service that lives behind a URL with a self-signed certificate, the agent will not communicate with that URL without first providing it with the certificate to validate all requests with.

You will need your endpoints certificates content, which you need to put into `values.yaml` - into the `topologyCertSecret` section, replacing the content already there. **Make sure never to commit or add this certificate to version control.**

If you require more than one certificate, you can use a Terminal to concatenate multiple certificates into a single block of text data. To do so, run `cat cert1.crt cert2.crt > combined.crt`, replacing the firs two `.crt` files with your own certificates. You will also need to ensure new lines are between the certificates `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` blocks. You are looking for something that looks like:
```
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
ENCODED DATA IN HERE
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
ENCODED DATA IN HERE
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

This can then be added to the correct value in `values.yaml` inside the `cics-agent` folder.

> Ensure there are no extra lines or white space between certificates and avoid adding white space after the last certificate.
